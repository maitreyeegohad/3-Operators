# Operators
## Aim: 
To study and implement operators in c++

## Theory: 
Operators in C++ are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on data, enabling tasks like arithmetic, comparisons, and logical evaluations. They are categorized into several types:
### 1. Arithmetic Operators: 
Used for basic math operations, 
- **Addition (+):**  Adds two operands.
- **Subtraction (-):** Subtracts the second operand from the first.
- **Multiplication (*):** Multiplies two operands.
- **Division (/):** Divides the numerator by the denominator.
- **Modulus (%):** Returns the remainder of the division.

### 2. Relational Operators: 
Used for comparisons, such as ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=.
- **Equal to (==):** Checks if two operands are equal.
- **Not equal to (!=):** Checks if two operands are not equal.
- **Greater than (>):** Checks if the left operand is greater than the right.
- **Less than (<):** Checks if the left operand is less than the right.
- **Greater than or equal to (>=):** Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right.
- **Less than or equal to (<=):** Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right.

### 3. Logical Operators: 
Allow combining conditions, using &&, ||, and !.
- **Logical AND (&&):** Returns true if both operands are true.
- **Logical OR (||):** Returns true if at least one operand is true.
- **Logical NOT (!):** Reverses the logical state of its operand.

### 4. Bitwise Operators: 
Perform operations on bits, including &, |, ^, ~, <<, and >>.
- **AND (&):** Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
- **OR (|):** Sets each bit to 1 if at least one bit is 1.
- **XOR (^):** Sets each bit to 1 if bits are different.
- **NOT (~):** Inverts all bits.
- **Left Shift (<<):** Shifts bits left, filling with zeros.
- **Right Shift (>>):** Shifts bits right, preserving sign for signed types.

### 5. Assignment Operators: 
Assign values and can perform operations like =, +=, -=, *=, and /=.
- **Simple Assignment (=):** Assigns the right operand to the left operand.
- **Add and Assign (+=):** Adds the right operand to the left and assigns the result.
- **Subtract and Assign (-=):** Subtracts the right operand from the left and assigns the result.
- **Multiply and Assign (=):** Multiplies and assigns the result.
- **Divide and Assign (/=):** Divides and assigns the result.
- **Modulus and Assign (%=):** Applies modulus and assigns the result.

### 6. Increment/Decrement Operators: 
Increase or decrease a variable's value by one (++ and --).
- **Increment (++):** Increases the value by 1.
- **Decrement (--):** Decreases the value by 1.
